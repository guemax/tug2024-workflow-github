# Currently we run in two situations:
on:
  # 1) Whenever someone pushes to a branch
  push:
  # 2) Whenever a pull request is opened, reopened or gets new commits.
  pull_request:
# This implies that for every push to a local branch in our repo for which a
# pull request is open this runs twice. But it's important to ensure that pull
# requests get tested even if their branch comes from a fork.

# Cancel running builds on push on the same branch or pull request
