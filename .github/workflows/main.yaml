# Currently we run in two situations:
on:
  # Whenever someone pushes to a branch or tag in our repo
  push:
    branches:
      - "*"
  # Whenever a pull request is opened, reopened or gets new commits.
  pull_request:
# This implies that for every push to a local branch in our repo for which a
# pull request is open this runs twice. But it's important to ensure that pull
# requests get tested even if their branch comes from a fork.
